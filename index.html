	<p>Hi, this is my page for a few things. I created it as a personal project to share a few things with anyone that wants (and to practice coding)! I'm going to
	upload cool pictures that I've taken over the years and cool academic/personal projects. This is also to help with the lifesaving courses
	and tutorials that I teach as part-time work. </a></p>




	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p> I'm currently just about to graduate from <a href="https://reporter.mcgill.ca/mcgill-on-the-rise-in-pair-of-world-university-rankings/">McGill Univerity</a> with a B.Science in 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&ab_channel=CrashCourse">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo&ab_channel=DoS-DomainofScience">Physics</a>. 
	I'm currently a Computational Physics Researcher at the <a href="https://rimuhc.ca">Research Institute</a> - McGill University Hospital Centers' Medical Physics Unit studying two things; 
	Using computer vision, we are trying to developp softwares that diagnose radio-therapies based on patient-specific tumour models based on microdosimetry principles. 
	The second thing I'm working on is using Convolutinal Neural Networks to help with fast-dose predcitions using Monte-Carlo search tree principles to dose radiation.</p>
		
	<p>I have just agreed to start a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour-actualite/nouvelles/luniversite-de-montreal-et-ses-ecoles-affiliees-hec-montreal-et-polytechnique-montreal-se">Université de Montreal - École Polytechnique</a> 
	under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=OU5TZScAAAAJ&hl=en">Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau</a> in the Laboratoire d'Interprétation et de Traitement d'Images et Vidéo 
	<a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/litiv/en/">(LITIV)</a>. I'll be working on deep learning methods (Artificial Intelligence) for image and video object recognition, to be better defined soon. 
	In my spare time I like adventure sports, especially climbing, and play a few other sports to stay in shape. I've been travelling quite a bit in the last few years and have been working in those places.</a></p>

	<h2> Some things I find interesting </h2>
	<p> Some really good research papers </p>

	<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270"> How Alpha Go Beat the World Champion </a></li>
  	<li><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-break-traveling-salesperson-record-20201008/"> How I guy made his career off making a famous problem one billionth times faster.</a></li>
  	<li><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/"> Climate change is real... and scary :( </a></li>
	</ul>

	<p> My political thought right now (they change a lot) </p>
