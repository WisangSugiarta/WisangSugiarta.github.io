	<p>Hi, this is my page for a few things. I created it as a personal project to share a few things with anyone that wants! I'm going to
	upload cool pictures that I've taken over the years and cool academic/personal projects. This is also to help with the lifesaving courses
	and tutorials that I teach as part-time work. </a></p>

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p> I'm currently in my last year at McGill University studying Honours Computer Science and Physics. Next year, I'll be starting my master's degree in
	Medical Physics McGill with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence applied to Nuclear Physics. On my spare time I like adventure sports, especially climbing,
	and play a few other sports to stay in shape. I've been travelling quite a bit in the last few years and have been working in those places.</a></p>
