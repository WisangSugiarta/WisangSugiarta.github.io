	<p>Hi, this is my page for a few things. I created it as a personal project to share a few things with anyone that wants (and to practice coding)! I'm going to
	upload cool pictures that I've taken over the years and cool academic/personal projects. This is also to help with the lifesaving courses
	and tutorials that I teach as part-time work. </a></p>

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p> I'm currently just about to graduate from McGill Univerity with a B.Science in Computer Science and Physics. I'm currently a Computational Physics Researcher at 
	the <a href="https://rimuhc.ca">Research Institute</a> - McGill University Hospital Centers' Medical Physics Unit studying two things; Using computer vision, we are trying to developp softwares that diagnose radio-therapies
	based on patient-specific tumour models based on microdosimetry principles. The second thing I'm working on is using Convolutinal Neural Networks to help with fast-dose predcitions
	using Monte-Carlo search tree principles to dose radiation.</p>
		
	<p>I have just agreed to start a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour-actualite/nouvelles/luniversite-de-montreal-et-ses-ecoles-affiliees-hec-montreal-et-polytechnique-montreal-se">Université de Montreal - École Polytechnique</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=OU5TZScAAAAJ&hl=en">Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau</a>
	in the Laboratoire d'Interprétation et de Traitement d'Images et Vidéo <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/litiv/en/">(LITIV)</a>. I'll be working on deep learning methods for 
	image and video object recognition, to be better defined soon.On my spare time I like adventure sports, especially climbing, and play a few other sports to stay in shape.
	I've been travelling quite a bit in the last few years and have been working in those places.</a></p>
